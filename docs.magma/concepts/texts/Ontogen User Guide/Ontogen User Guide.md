# Ontogen User Guide

## Description

The "Ontogen User Guide" should introduce new Ontogen users to

-   what Ontogen is
-   what they can do with it
-   how they can use it
-   the underlying data, provenance and versioning model
-   limitations of the first MVP version

Here's a first idea for an outline:

-   **Introduction**: What is Ontogen?
-   **Basics**: The fundamentals of the data, provenance and versioning model of Ontogen (incl. a short introduction to RTC)
-   **Repositories**: What is a repository in Ontogen and how do we create one?
-   **Commands**: How to perform basic commands.
    -   **Commits**: How to use the `commit` command to add changes to a dataset.
    -   **Checking Changes:** How to use the `changes` command to review the changes made to a dataset since the last commit.
    -   **Reviewing History:** How to use the `history` command to review all the versions of a dataset.
    -   **Reverting Changes:** How to use the `revert` command to return to a previous version of a dataset.
-   **Limitations and Roadmap**
